## Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently building AI projects using Generative AI (LLM models), Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to solve real-world problem statements and strengthen my knowledge in the AI field.

🌱 I have strong knowledge of LLMs, RAG pipelines, model fine-tuning, and core ML/DL concepts, and I continuously enhance my understanding through hands-on experimentation and learning.

👯 I’m open to collaborating on end-to-end AI and Data Science projects — from data preprocessing and model development to evaluation and deployment.

💬 Ask me about LLM workflows, Fine-tuning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning architectures, NLP concepts, and Python for AI — always open to meaningful technical discussions.
